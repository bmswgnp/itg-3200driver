This project is a free initiative to create Arduino driver for ITG-3200 3 axis gyro.
The main goal is to provide a driver that simplifies the usage of this particular gyro in Arduino projects.

Gyro Features (from InvenSense website):

•Digital-output X-, Y-, and Z-Axis angular rate sensors (gyros) on one integrated circuit with a sensitivity of 14 LSBs per °/sec and a full-scale range of ±2000°/sec
•Three integrated 16-bit ADCs provide simultaneous sampling of gyros while requiring no external multiplexer
•Digitally-programmable low-pass filter
•Fast Mode I²C (400kHz) serial interface
•Low 6.5mA operating current for long battery life
•Wide VDD supply voltage range of 2.1V to 3.6V
•Flexible VLOGIC reference voltage allows for I²C interface voltages from 1.71V to VDD
•Standby current: 5µA
•Smallest and thinnest package for portable devices (4x4x0.9mm QFN)
•Turn on time: 50ms
•Digital-output temperature sensor
•Factory calibrated scale factor
•On-chip temperature sensor
•10,000 g shock tolerant
•On-chip timing generator clock frequency is accurate to +/-2% over full temperature range
•MEMS structure hermetically sealed and bonded at wafer level
•RoHS and Green compliant
